Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?. @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber  a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.. @MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.. @martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp  elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.. @FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear.. @realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!. @realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.. If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles  let people decide what makes them happy. A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated  belted for high speed safety.. Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).. @joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely. Presentation starting at 8:15. @CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go. The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination  then drives on normal roads back to start. @flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster  way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better.. All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians  cyclists. Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.. @alanrrios @boringcompany Yes.

Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements..

Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle.

And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.. @neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude.

Yup.. “Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo. @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation  you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.. @dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients?

Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.. @WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.. @WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars  stationary storage. @WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack  front  rear single piece castings.

Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.. Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1  N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable  above 40 cycles is not. @RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable.. @RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles  40 cycles is their max.. @PPathole Strange. @ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold  flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms  falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.. @ryaneshea Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.. @ryaneshea From. @dana_e_morgan Sure is. Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?. @ClareCraigPath Interesting. @john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting. What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test  is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?. @PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. False positives will roughly scale with of tests  daily test rate has gone ballistic:. @justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles  cough  slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.. @cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.. The carousel turns ever faster. @JoeInGeneral @andrewbogut Yup. @ajtourville Exactly. @JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.. @BLKMDL3 If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.. Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.. @austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines.. @tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.. @austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork.",0.067,0.772,0.16,0.9963
