Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :). Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range  power  fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.. Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.. I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful.. Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien. I hope that didn't work. ~spawn npc.alien.

East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters. A Shortfall of Gravitas. A third is under construction. Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be  will if BFR takes longer than expected.. Side boosters landing on droneships  center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended.

Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.. Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.. To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production.. ABS calibration algorithm. Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise  many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.. Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.. Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️. Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little. Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp  trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.. Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.. The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this.. Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers. Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance  others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out  address.

Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.. It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution. I would def recommend this. Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks  front/rear rope tow hitch  lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?. Interesting. Great, thanks. Inflatable tubes  pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand  is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.. So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out  water won’t come in. Does you know output voltage  amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.. SpaceX  Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.. Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd  3rd would need battery packs, air pumps  tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up  then transit.. So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.. Have a small velcro slit entrance  exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction). Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.. Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network  inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof  auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.",0.059,0.855,0.086,0.9071

Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.. Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more.

So cool. Anything with high contrast. Excessive shades of grey. Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy  immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.. Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week. Depends on destination. Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level. Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.. Chomsky sucks. Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite. Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!. More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven. Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.. Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design  replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though.

We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place  only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room  moment of inertia is much lower.. Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table. Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.. Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.. Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.. This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation.

We’re working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.. Karma is real. Yeah, super messed up. These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment. Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators.

Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!. I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 🤣🤣. . please fix this misunderstanding. Exactly. What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists. “Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.. “Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo. A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation  you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.. Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?. I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington. We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights  stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.. We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.. Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.. Sure. Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …. SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator  static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.. That’s for sure! 😅. I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀. My (again) personal favorite is. Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially . Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets  is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.. Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat  driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.. SN26. Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!. The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!. Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch. Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage  payload separation system also not US.. Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips  Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation  setting PEEP  O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage.. Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.. Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!. Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!. Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often  is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.. Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.. True. Only reason other medium  heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention.

We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice.

Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1  N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable  above 40 cycles is not. Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable.. Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles  40 cycles is their max.. Strange. Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold  flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms  falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.. Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.. From. Sure is. Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?. Interesting. Interesting. What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test  is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?.
